I love how minimalistic it is with the relevant features .
The only bad thing about it is the frequent ads considering that I'm not using the pro version .
Also, hoping this would be available for desktops too .
Good for planning your outing especially fishing with a boat .
I was ecstatic really to have found this app .
It would be nice if you add "Sort Alphabetically" .
And when I search *heart, I want *hearts icons to appear too .
Love it .
Just need few additional features like adding inbetween comments of tracking for future reference .
I love this app! I've used it for years to keep track of things or to jot ideas down .
It's so easy to navigate that it doesn't even need a tutorial .
I do wish it had the option to have an incognito mode when you put your password in backwards or something in case you needed to hide a gift list or something when someone questioned what was in there so that you could show them without actually showing them your true notes .
But overall love the app .
I want to love this app but the address navigation is terrible .
You have to select by city/town/locality .
So you'll select the city, the street, and then street number .
However, there are some significant gaps in the numbers .
Searching by the POI was even more unreliable .
DONT INSTALL SO SLOW SPLITTING A 5 MINUTE VIDEO .
I USED ANOTHER APP AND IT DID IT IN 10 SECONDS IT ALSO COUDNT FIND MY VIDEO I WANTED TO TRIM FOR WHATSAPP .
