Really enjoy this game .
Exactly what I needed .
Add a DONATION BUTTON .
This is also really handy on Bluetooth keyboards that can't access even Android's limited character input (which makes me glad it's NOT integrated with a stock keyboard) .
There are videos to show me how to do the stretch correctly if I am not sure .
Doesn't want inside leg measurement .
Last time I ran it, It couldn't calculate correct distance ran .
Needs additional features - using User ID/code instead of my phone number etc .
Ad free .
Also, widgets cannot be resized .
I had follow the instruction to upload KMZ file on android 12 .
newly improved version is too good .
Widget not the way it used to be No more 5 day forecast , temp and local temp .
This application has changed my life!!! The only thing I would change is for the administrator of the list to have more control and the other members not as well as being ableto send individual reminders .
I'm mad that the premium key I purchased doesn't apply anymore, but I'm even more mad that I can't buy it again .
Just gets junkier and junkier .
I like the science but I don't particularly care who goes to the moon or Mars .
Just what I wanted in a weather app .
Constant ads trying to upsell you .
App drains battery like teenager pumpkin spice latte .
Top notch and couldn't ask for more .
More grace to the developer .
I have several but have to use different video apps .
1. Unable to move camera thumbnail position .
My phone says: This app has 787 irregular activities since last charge which is excessive processor usage when screen is off." .
Is a well done job that needed award .
Keep your contacts safe -- forever .
It helps as in I don't have to constantly take the SD card out but it's slow and I'm no way will it let me use it as a controller for my garmin 45 .
4. Sometimes the camera still works for few more seconds even after turned off during video calls .
UPDATE3: Dear Milan, App still not working even on another phone with all power & battery optimization disabled .
It wd be good if you add timer or reminder  .
The videos made it easy and entertaining to learn extremely important lessons! I'm a therapist and recommend this to my clients .
I had 5 passes on my account and they've expired .
Increase the level of this stupid app All rank is easily achieved N make it tough after UDARNIK .
Reminders not working .
My only wish is that it has some radar and satellite maps .
I'm dropping my rating due to the length of time it takes to download maps .
I used this app for years .
No longer usable .
Scam! Don't sign up for the free trial as they will take the money off your card .
I have a very up to date phone so idk .
Wow nice game I liked the music ðŸŽ¶ And the Duel races .
If I wanted to read text that small I'd just use the app on my phone .
But good thing I know how to defend myself .
Nice message App though it is always wanting to open Add while my Data is on .
can't log in my fcebook and gmail but i love mtb project .
Do not use this garbage app .
Fun to use with the medal challenges .
i have yet to check features like reminder .
Thanks team! .
Most of the integers are good, but there's a jump from 8 to 20 minutes in one week, then another from 10 to 22 another week, which again seems unrealistic for a beginner .
I think this app is a GREAT help because it tells you if there are optimization problems with your phone created by the manufacturer and giives you ways to bypass those problems so the apps will function as designed by the app developer .
This has been a huge help in remembering things i need to accomplish for the day .
Highly recommended .
Dev, give me the option to outright buy the app .
Disgraceful customer service! .
I got myself TomTomGo , because I need reliable updated navigation .
Easy format to understand .
I was ecstatic (really) to have found this app .
I like this app because even I miss the news whether I now I'm still wach to the app .
Edit - I installed the update and have not been able to use the app at all .
I would never have knowingly agreed to that .
You can also insert images so you know instantly what the list is about .
Nice little tool for tasks that don't need a date .
Then you send out another update and the app works fine .
Just don't waste your money on Garmin .
Poorly made, messages don't come through when you're in the app, you have to open it again and even then they don't show half the time .
It's really anoying to install this app!! I don't recommend this .
Great game I like it please bring some more good games like this game ðŸ‘ðŸ‘ðŸ‘ðŸ‘ðŸ‘ðŸ‘ðŸ‘ðŸ‘ðŸ¤œðŸ¤›ðŸ¤œðŸ¤›ðŸ¤œðŸ¤›ðŸ¤œðŸ¤› .
2. When the application is minimised, no way to know video is on .
Best to do app I found so far! Keep up the good work guys! .
I seem it is a great way to do excersise bu himself .
However app could use work on customizing options .
10-april-22 - the app wont let me change or add color palettes anymore .
Two feature requests that would make this perfect in my opinion: Make the checkbox hotspot on the widget slightly bigger so that it's easier to mark off a task without accidentally bringing up the edit pop up, and allow reoccurring tasks so that I can have a weekly or monthly section that I can mark off without losing contents as one-off completed tasks are auto removed .
It has way more color coding options for appointments that Google Calendar offers, which is very helpful .
I even paid for premium .
Quite intuitive for the most part .
What an absolute joke! The challenges won't even load they say "Data cannot be loaded right now" .
It is good to be able to track your heart rate and save these things because your doctor could review this and help diagnose a potential issue and treat it early on rather than too late .
5 â­ rating .
It's hard for me to describe but I just love how it displays the weather data I want to see .
Extreme alerts should at least have the option to bypass silent/vibrate modes .
Know when to stay indoors, limit activity, avoid further microscopic damage to your lungs from smoke particulates .
Very handy guide to trails around the country .
The interface is more functional than I would have expected .
Simple and hassle free .
Have used (and paid for!) this app for several years .
Tested on both Android and iPhone/Carplay using Waze as a comparison .
Thanks to you many people are going to become their best selfs (me included) .
There are some days where i missed tick-ing them .
Such a shame .
So you'll select the city, the street, and then street number .
The hurricane predictions in south Louisiana are a must .
What happened? .
Either group them on kind (tornado watch, tornado warning, etc) or type (advisorys together, watches together, warnings together, etc) .
The only bad thing about it is the frequent ads (considering that I'm not using the pro version) .
I look for a long time for such a type of app till I find this amazing appðŸ‘ðŸ‘ ðŸ‘ .
not worth, very few features, widget are also very limited .
Great app! I have 2 suggestions that would improve usability .
And i cant rely on reporting profiles as theres an insane amount of fake profile .
